### 2. Create a variable named `age` and initialize it to your age. Use **conditional statement** to print `valid` if age is greater than 18 else print `Not Valid` .

### 3. Use `for` loop to print numbers from `1` to `50` .

### 4. Use any loop to traverse numbers from `1` to `100`. If the number is divisible by `3` print `Deja`, If number is divisble by `5` print `Vu`. If number is divisble by both `3` and `5` print `DejaVu`.
